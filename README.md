# scrutus

A linter for source-code comments. scrutus finds comments that are wrong or
that say nothing the code does not, reports them like any other linter, and
deletes the useless ones.

Each comment is paired with the code it describes and scored by
[TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai)'s Jev model for accuracy and usefulness.
The model only scores; fixed local thresholds decide what is reported and what
is deleted.

> **OpenJEV support:** Jev is built by [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai). This
> fork keeps TypeSafe as the default and adds optional support for
> [OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh), a free community gateway to the same Jev
> model — set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or `JEV_PROVIDER=openjev`) to use it. Original
> project: https://github.com/SergeAx/scrutus by @SergeAx.

> **Status: v0.1, pre-release.** Go, PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript and Python
> sources are supported; see the
> [implementation status](docs/design_spec.0.1.md#124-implementation-status).

## Install

Download the binary for your platform from the
[`edge` release](https://github.com/SergeAx/scrutus/releases/tag/edge): Linux
and macOS on amd64 and arm64, Windows on amd64. Until versioned releases start,
it is rebuilt from every push to `master`; `scrutus version` names the commit.
Each binary carries signed build provenance, which the GitHub CLI checks:

```sh
gh attestation verify scrutus-linux-amd64 -R SergeAx/scrutus
```

The macOS binaries are not notarized, so clear the quarantine flag a browser
download sets: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine scrutus-darwin-arm64`.

Or build from source with Go 1.27 or newer:

```sh
go install github.com/SergeAx/scrutus/cmd/scrutus@latest
```

JavaScript, TypeScript and Python are parsed by tree-sitter, which is C, so
`go install` compiles them in only when a C compiler is on your `PATH`;
without one you get Go and PHP. `scrutus version` lists the languages a binary
carries.

## Quickstart

Set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in your environment, or put it in a `.env` file in the
working directory or next to the executable. To use
[OpenJEV](https://openjev.sh) instead, set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` (or
`JEV_PROVIDER=openjev`). Then preview what scrutus would
delete, without writing anything:

```sh
scrutus fix --diff ./...
```

Review everything it flags:

```sh
scrutus check ./...
```

```text

    accuracy   [----------]   3%  Fundamentally wrong
    usefulness [#---------]  13%  No information beyond the code

    code       func Total(c Charge, quantity int64) int64 { return c.AmountCents * quantity }

16 comments in 2 files: 1 error, 4 warning, 2 info
0 cached, 12 assessed in 12 request(s), 2 suppressed, 0 baselined
cost $0.00020 (4800 input tokens), 11ms
```

Then `scrutus fix ./...` deletes the comments marked `delete`. Wrong comments
are flagged and left for a person to fix.

## Usage

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Lint locally | `scrutus check ./...` |
| Pre-commit hook | `scrutus fix --staged` |
| CI annotations | `scrutus check --changed --format sarif -o scrutus.sarif` |
| Adopt on a legacy codebase | `scrutus baseline ./...`, then commit `baseline.json` |

`--staged` and `--changed` score only comments inside the changed hunks, so an
old comment elsewhere in the file never blocks a commit. `fix` exits 1 when it
has deleted something, so a pre-commit hook fails and you restage. In CI,
`fix` refuses to write files unless you pass `--allow-ci-write`.

Report formats: `text` (the default in a terminal), `json` (the default when
piped), `sarif`, `github`, `rdjson` and `checkstyle`. Run `scrutus help check`
for every flag.

## Configuration

scrutus reads `.scrutus.toml` from the working directory or the nearest
directory above it. Flags override the file.

```toml
version = 1
profile = "default"              # strict | default | lenient
languages = ["go", "php"]
ignore = ["vendor/**", "**/*_test.go"]

[jev]
model = "jev-latest"             # pin a version in CI for stable verdicts
# provider = "openjev"           # use OpenJEV instead of TypeSafe
# base_url = "https://api.openjev.sh"  # override the endpoint
```

List only the languages you want scored. When a file in scope belongs to a
configured language this build cannot parse, scrutus exits 2 instead of
silently skipping the file, so a build without the tree-sitter languages
needs the list narrowed.

These comments are never scored: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, license
headers, shebangs, encoding lines, tool directives such as `//go:`, `nolint`,
`@phpstan-`, `{@inheritDoc}`, `prettier-ignore` or `# noqa`, and anything shorter than 12
characters. Exempt more prefixes with `extend_exempt_prefixes` under
`[comments]`; `exempt_prefixes` replaces the whole default list. To silence a
single comment, put `scrutus:ignore` in it or `scrutus:ignore-next` on the line
above. See the
[config file reference](docs/design_spec.0.1.md#42-config-file) for every
setting.

## How comments are judged

A doc comment is judged against the whole declaration it documents. An inline
comment is judged against the paragraph of code below it, up to the next blank
line. A trailing comment is judged against the statement on its line. Jev
answers four questions about each pair:

- **Accuracy**: is it fundamentally wrong, materially misleading, roughly
  correct, or accurate?
- **Usefulness**: does it add no information, a marginal hint, a useful why or
  edge case, or context without which the code would be misread?
- **Overreach**: does it describe code outside its pair, such as the whole
  function?
- **Commented out**: is it disabled code rather than prose? Annotation tags are
  not asked.

The first matching rule wins, in this order:

| Rule | Severity | Action | When, under the default profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `commented-out-code` | warning | delete | Commented out 0.7 or higher; only under `strict` |
| `low-confidence` | info | flag | Model confidence below 0.5 |
| `wide-scope` | info | flag | Overreach 0.8 or higher, except on doc comments |
| `wrong-comment` | error | flag | Accuracy 30% or lower |
| `useless-comment` | warning | delete | Usefulness 15% or lower |
| `redundant-annotation` | warning | flag | A useless `@param`, `@var` or similar tag |
| `weak-comment` | warning | flag | Accuracy 60% or lower, or usefulness 35% or lower |

Commented-out code is skipped under the default and `lenient` profiles and
deleted under `strict`; set `commented_out_code = "ignore"` or `"delete"` under
`[comments]` to choose regardless of profile. Wrong comments are never deleted
automatically, because one may be the only sign that the code next to it is
wrong too. A useless doc comment on an exported Go identifier or a Python
docstring is reported as `weak-comment` instead of being deleted.
If deleting comments leaves a file that no longer parses, scrutus keeps the
original file and reports `fix-aborted`. The
[design spec](docs/design_spec.0.1.md#6-classification-and-policy) explains the
reasoning behind each rule.

## Cost and caching

Jev charges $0.042 per million input tokens and nothing for output. A comment
costs about 590 input tokens, so 100,000 comments cost about $2.50. Each run
stops at `--budget` cents, 50 by default. Verdicts are cached, keyed on the
comment, its code, the rubric version and the model, so unchanged comments are
not scored again.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | No findings at or above `--fail-on`, which defaults to `error` |
| 1 | Findings at or above `--fail-on`, or `fix` deleted something |
| 2 | Tool error: bad config, API failure, or a language this build cannot parse |
| 3 | Budget exceeded, before or during the run |

An API outage is exit 2, never a finding. `--soft-fail` turns connection
failures into exit 0.

## Development
